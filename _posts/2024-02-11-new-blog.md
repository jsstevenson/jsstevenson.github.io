I've rewritten this site as a Jekyll blog. I'd held out for a long time -- originally, my personal site was built by a [static site generator that I wrote myself](https://github.com/jsstevenson/bssg) while procrastinating on an assignment for an OS course. Unfortunately, it was starting to show its brittleness with new updates, so I decided to move it over to a Jekyll site. It turns out that basically all of the features I'd engineered in my own generator also exist (in a much, much better way) in Jekyll, so the transition was easy enough.

I hope to get around to pulling together a simple custom theme, but in the meantime, I'm running a [popular academic theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio). Frankly, I think it's a little overpowered, and it took me an hour just to delete everything that seemed superfluous, but hey. It has a dark mode option. I can't complain.

For the sake of provenance, the old version of the site should be accessible [here](/assets/static/jsstevenson.github.io/).
