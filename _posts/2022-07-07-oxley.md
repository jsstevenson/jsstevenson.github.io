I've just pushed version 0.0.1 of [Oxley](https://github.com/jsstevenson/oxley/), a Python package that ingests JSONschema and dynamically constructs [Pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic) classes and their attendant features, including runtime data validation, schema generation, and interoperability with web frameworks like [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). This is the first package I've published on PyPI that I've entirely self-produced, and I'm excited to see where it goes.

The niche is a simple one: data streams are places of chaos, but forcing adherance to external schemas can ensure some kinds of correctness and enhance interoperability with other sources. JSONschema is a pretty good framework for writing schema definitions, and some solutions (e.g. [Python-JSONschema-Objects](https://github.com/cwacek/python-jsonschema-objects)) enable easy and relatively well-featured runtime validation in Python environments. To my knowledge, though, Oxley is the first to employ Pydantic in this validation structure, which is great if you're working on something like a FastAPI endpoint (as we often do in the [Wagner lab](https://github.com/GenomicMedLab)). Even beyond standing up APIs, Pydantic has cemented itself as a Python developer favorite, and I think targeting its core functionality makes sense for fully fleshing out the possibilities of validation-by-schema.

My current feature target is to fully represent everyting in the [Variant Representation Specification](https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/), but I'm also interested in covering other components of the 2020 spec (and earlier iterations as well, eventually). Pull requests welcome.
