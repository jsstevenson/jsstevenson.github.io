They are commonly used in situations with imbalanced classes, such as cancer diagnosis and cell type annotation. We evaluated 10 popular tools for plotting PRC and computing AUPRC, which were collectively used in &gt;3,000 published studies. We found the AUPRC values computed by the tools rank classifiers differently and some tools produce overly-optimistic results.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are, apparently, a handful of different ways to compute the “curves” for PRC and AUROC, which makes sense (given that they’re all built from discrete values), and apparently (per this paper) some consensus that certain methods are more “optimistic” than they should be. It goes on to detail inconsistencies in method usage (and visualization) between core statistical libraries, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scikit-learn</code>, with pretty striking results:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/auprc_figure-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/auprc_figure-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/auprc_figure-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/auprc_figure.png" class="img-fluid z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>In some cases, these are pretty startling differences. They do note that, in the case of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scikit-learn</code>, the documentation at least notes the particulars of the method used, but personally, it wasn’t something I’d ever thought to pay attention to before.</p> </body></html>
